# Non-land Costs

Values come from [Ohio State University Extension](https://farmoffice.osu.edu/farm-management-tools/farm-budgets). Usually, a year's budget will be uploaded on the site in October of the year prior to the year in question. There will typically be updates to the budgets throughout the year with a finalized version sometime in May.
