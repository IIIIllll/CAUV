# Capitalization rate information, mostly from USDA-ERS

# Can't really download this in any automated way, bummer.

# Keep in mind that the values used for capitalization rates may be jumbled!
#  For instance, the rollbacks used in the tax year 2019 formula would be based
#  on the value that ODT has for the tax year 2018!
