# Capitalization rate information, mostly from USDA-ERS

# https://data.ers.usda.gov/reports.aspx?ID=17838

# Can't really download this in any automated way, so the file in the cap_rate
# folder will need to be manually updated

# Keep in mind that the values used for capitalization rates may be jumbled!
#  For instance, the rollbacks used in the tax year 2019 formula would be based
#  on the value that ODT has for the tax year 2018! Please read the 
#  documentation for the capitalization rate
