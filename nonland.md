# Non-land Costs

Values come from [Ohio State University Extension](https://farmoffice.osu.edu/farm-management-tools/farm-budgets). Usually, a year's budget will be uploaded on the site in October of the year prior to the year in question. There will typically be updates to the budgets throughout the year with a finalized version sometime in May. Due to the complex nature of the budgets, these data must be manually downloaded to each crops respective folder in [0-data/osu_budget/raw](0-data/osu_budget/raw) and the values manually input into the [0-data/osu_budget/osu_budgets - R.csv](0-data/osu_budget/osu_budgets - R.csv) file.

Data description of each item in the budget can be found [in the README for the folder](0-data/osu_budget/).
